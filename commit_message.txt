feat: Add and update project READMEs and enhance functionality

This commit introduces comprehensive README files for all 10 microservice projects, detailing their purpose, tech stack, and a standardized footer.

Key changes include:
- Generated a `README.md` for each project directory.
- Updated Dockerfiles and docker-compose configurations for better containerization and service orchestration.
- Enhanced multiple services with improved code structure, dependencies, and features. For example, the `html5-arcade-game` received significant gameplay and UI upgrades, and the `media-gallery-platform` was modernized with a new client structure and improved API.
- Added new assets and frontend components across various projects to improve user experience.
